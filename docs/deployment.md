# Deployment

## Bootstrap (`make bootstrap`)

`make bootstrap` runs `scripts/bootstrap.py`, a guided prompt that produces
the **layer 1** bootstrap artifact described in
[Configuration](configuration.md). For a remote source it clones or refreshes
the initial local checkout, but never modifies its `platform-config.yaml`.

Prompts:

1. **Deployment target** — `compose` or `kubernetes`.
2. **Compose mode** — `local` or `production`. Local mode asks for the
   internet-reachable Gateway URL used by signed approval callbacks, binds the
   browser UI to `127.0.0.1:3000`, selects the local sandbox mode, and disables
   private auth ingress.
3. **Workflow source** — `remote` (git URL + ref + initial checkout path) or
   `local` (an existing filesystem checkout path). Compose bind-mounts the
   checkout; Kubernetes uses the checkout's config for cold start and then
   performs remote syncs with the configured GitHub App.
4. **One-time clone PAT** (remote only, optional for public repositories). It
   is supplied to Git only through a temporary `GIT_ASKPASS` process and is
   never written to `compose.env`, a Kubernetes Secret, the Git remote URL, or
   platform config. All subsequent workflow sync, Knowledge Source sync,
   version lookup, reflection PR, and GitHub MCP operations use the named
   GitHub App connections in `platform-config.yaml`.
   Kubernetes bootstrap also prompts for the target namespace; use the same
   namespace with `helm upgrade`.
5. **AGE identity** — an armored
   `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` string or a path to a key file. A path is read into
   the generated secret artifact so it works inside containers.
6. **LLM API key** — one
   key shared by runtime model profiles and Hindsight's LLM/embeddings clients.
7. **Postgres password** and **object-store secret key** —
   direct-container secrets required by Compose infrastructure.
8. **OIDC client secret** and **OAuth2 proxy cookie secret** — production
   Compose only. Bootstrap stores them in the generated, mode-`0600`
   `compose.env`; non-secret issuer/client coordinates stay in the workflow
   repo's committed `deploy/compose.env`.

Generated artifact per target (none of these are committed):

| Target | Artifact | Apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compose` | `compose.env` | `make up` |
| `kubernetes` | `dist/bootstrap/k8s-secret.sh` | run the script to create/update bootstrap and `platform-config.yaml` Secrets |

### Production Compose OIDC and TLS

Provision a confidential OIDC client with the authorization-code flow, PKCE
support, and the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes. Register exactly
`${CONTROL_PLANE_UI_URL}/oauth2/callback` as an allowed callback URL. The
callback is required: after authentication, the provider returns the browser
to OAuth2 Proxy at that endpoint so it can validate the authorization code and
establish the UI session.

The private production override exposes only OAuth2 Proxy's HTTPS listener and
uses secure cookies, so production Compose requires TLS even if an identity
provider permits an HTTP localhost callback for development. A locally signed
or self-signed certificate is sufficient for a single-machine trial when its
issuing certificate is trusted by every browser that accesses the UI, its SAN
matches the `CONTROL_PLANE_UI_URL` hostname, and that hostname resolves from
the browser. Use a corporate or publicly trusted certificate for shared use.

Set the resulting issuer URL and client ID in the workflow repo's committed
`deploy/compose.env`. Supply the client secret through production bootstrap;
never commit it. `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` and `OIDC_ALLOWED_GROUP` control group
admission after login.

## Kubernetes deployment

Bootstrap creates the operator-owned `sage-run-bootstrap` Secret and an
`sage-run-config` Secret from the initial checkout. It does not
create container images, object-store buckets, or the Helm release. Configure
the chart with `platformConfig.existingSecret=sage-run-config`.

Use the following command after creating/pushing the image tags referenced by
your workflow repo's `deploy/k8s-values.yaml` and provisioning the configured
object-store bucket for workflow releases and agent memory:

```sh
make k8s-deploy \
   K8S_RELEASE=sage-run \
   K8S_NAMESPACE=sage-run \
   K8S_VALUES_FILE=/path/to/workflow-repo/deploy/k8s-values.yaml \
   K8S_PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/workflow-repo/platform-config.yaml \
   K8S_PLATFORM_CONFIG_SECRET=sage-run-config
```

`k8s-deploy` applies the generated bootstrap Secret, upserts the
`platform-config.yaml` Secret, then runs `helm upgrade --install --wait
--atomic`. To apply later platform-config, MCP/connector, replica, or image-tag
changes, use the same arguments with `make k8s-update`. It upserts the
platform-config Secret and runs the same Helm upgrade without changing bootstrap
credentials. `K8S_NAMESPACE` must match the namespace embedded by
`make bootstrap` in `dist/bootstrap/k8s-secret.sh`.

For platform code changes, first build and push new **immutable** image tags,
update the corresponding `images.*.tag` values, then run `make k8s-update`.
Reapplying `latest` does not necessarily change a Deployment pod template and
therefore does not provide a reliable rollout.

## Which services actually start

Compose gates every optional MCP server and connector behind a profile (see
`deploy/docker-compose.yml`'s `profiles:` entries); nothing reads
`platform-config.yaml` to decide this automatically for you. `make up` derives
the right profile set with `scripts/compose_profiles.py`, which reads the
instance's `platform-config.yaml`
(`$PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE`, or the bundled starter config)
and maps its `mcps.enabled`, `connectors.enabled` (by connector `type`), and
`model_profiles` (by `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) to the matching profile names:

```sh
make up
# Computed COMPOSE_PROFILES=gcp-pubsub,model-gateway,salesforce
```

The workflow repo owns a committed `deploy/compose.env` with non-secret
production coordinates. `make bootstrap` writes the separate, gitignored root
`compose.env` with bootstrap secrets, paths to the workflow deployment files,
and local-mode overrides when selected. The Makefile loads committed defaults
first and the generated file second.

Workflow Repo **Sync** is the release boundary for workflow packages and
repo-owned per-task runtime settings. After a successful sync, the selected
revision's `platform-config.yaml` is snapshotted with the workflow bundles; new
tasks use that snapshot for model profiles, context limits, and runtime env.
Running tasks retain their launch environment. This behavior is identical for
local-directory and remote Git workflow sources.

Sync does not reconcile long-running service topology. Changes to `mcps.enabled`
or `connectors.enabled` still require an operator deployment action: run
`make down && make up` for Compose, or update Helm/Kubernetes manifests through the
deployment control plane. The Workflow Repo UI should surface this requirement
when those settings change.

Legacy Compose database, volume, bucket, runtime-path, and Hindsight storage
identifiers must be changed through the verified backup and cutover procedure in
[SAGE Run Stateful Identifier Migration](sage-run-stateful-identifier-migration.md),
not by direct replacement in a running deployment.

Kubernetes (Helm) does **not** have an equivalent automatic derivation today:

- The Helm chart's `mcps.<id>.enabled` / `connectors.<id>.enabled` booleans in
  `values.yaml` directly gate which templates render — but the chart never
  reads `platform-config.yaml` itself, so these booleans have to be kept in
  sync with it by hand.

For remote private workflow repositories, the Helm chart uses an ephemeral
clone cache in Gateway and session-manager plus object storage as the durable
release transport. A successful UI Sync uploads immutable bundles and the
matching `platform-config.yaml`, then advances the active release pointer.
New tasks resolve both from that one release; no workflow-repo PVC is needed.
Kubernetes runtime Jobs use an `emptyDir` mounted at `/memory`; a helper
restores agent memory from object storage before the runtime starts and uploads
it after the runtime signals completion. PostgreSQL, self-hosted MinIO, and
Hindsight remain the only chart-managed components that need durable PVCs.

Large Knowledge Source repositories can require more memory during Graphify
extraction than a default local Docker VM provides. The Compose
`knowledge-indexer` has no container memory limit, so increasing a Compose
limit does not increase available memory; size the Docker Desktop or Rancher
Desktop VM instead. A 16 GiB VM is a practical starting point for large source
trees. For Kubernetes, give the `knowledge-indexer` pod a corresponding memory
request and limit through the deployment's resource policy.

## Local development (uncommitted working tree)

In the bootstrap prompt, choose the `local` workflow source so
`HOST_WORKFLOW_REPO_PATH` points at a plain filesystem checkout. **Sync now**
rebuilds the bundle from whatever is currently on disk — no git fetch, no
commit, no pinned tag required. Object storage is optional in this mode; a
local `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_ROOT` works fine.
When the workflow repository contains `deploy/docker-compose.override.yml`,
the Makefile loads it after the public base stack.

For a remote Compose source, the gateway manages the mounted workflow-repository
checkout: **Sync now** fetches the configured or pinned ref and checks out its
resolved commit before building bundles. Mount the repository root (including
`.git`), not its `workflows/` subdirectory. The gateway can update that checkout;
the session manager consumes the same checkout read-only, so workflow details
and newly built task bundles describe the same revision.

## `make` targets

| Target | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | `uv sync --extra dev`. |
| `bootstrap` | Run `scripts/bootstrap.py` interactively. |
| `sync` | Rebuild the active platform/workflow release through `GATEWAY_URL` (default `http://localhost:8080`). |
| `set-platform-secret` | Interactively encrypt a secret in the configured `platform-config.yaml`, then sync. |
| `set-workflow-secret WORKFLOW=<name>` | Interactively encrypt a secret in the selected workflow's `agent.yaml`, then sync. |
| `compose-build` | Build all Compose services. |
| `runtime-build` | Build the `sage-run-agent-runtime` image. |
| `build` | `runtime-build` + `compose-build`. |
| `up` / `down` | Start/stop the local Compose stack. |
| `k8s-deploy` | Apply the bootstrap/config Secrets and install the Helm release. |
| `k8s-update` | Upsert the config Secret and upgrade the Helm release. |
| `restart` | `down` + `build` + `up`. |
| `restart-<service>` | Rebuild and recreate one service, e.g. `make restart-postgres`. |
| `ensure-test-db` | Create the dedicated Postgres test database if missing. |
| `unit-tests` | `tests/unit` (no infra). |
| `service-tests` | `tests/service` against real Postgres. |
| `runtime-tests` | `tests/runtime` against real Postgres + Docker. |
| `tests` | All three suites. |
| `clean-test-containers` | Remove dangling test session containers. |
| `format` / `lint` | ruff fix+format / ruff check+format-check. |

## Deployment artifacts (`deploy/`)

- `deploy/docker-compose.yml` — the public base stack (Postgres, MinIO,
  gateway, session-manager, runtime image, control-plane UI, core MCPs).
   Mounts `HOST_WORKFLOW_REPO_PATH` and derives its `platform-config.yaml`
   (default `../examples/workflow-repo`),
  and `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_ROOT`. Optional profiles: `model-gateway`, `local-llm`,
   `salesforce`, `splunk`, `cloudwatch`, `github`, `jira`, `servicenow`,
   `gcp-pubsub`.
- `deploy/k8s/sage-run` — Kubernetes (Helm) chart; instance values select the
   platform-config secret/configmap, ephemeral workflow clone/release caches,
   object-store release bucket, bootstrap Secret, and which MCPs/connectors
   run. Postgres, S3-compatible storage, and Hindsight are external by default;
   a workflow repo can opt into chart-managed pgvector Postgres, MinIO, and
   Hindsight through `infrastructure.*.enabled` in its values file.

Private/customer deployments should commit non-secret Compose/Kubernetes values
in the workflow repo (`deploy/compose.env`, `deploy/k8s-values.yaml`) and use
the generated bootstrap artifact for secrets, rather than editing the public
base stack or adding a Compose override for shipped services.

## Workflow bundles

A **bundle** is the assembled, runnable package for one workflow: `CLAUDE.md`,
`agent.yaml`, `settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`,
and a `manifest.yaml`, merged from the platform core, the workflow repo's
shared assets, and the workflow itself (see
[Workflow authoring](workflow-authoring.md) for assembly/precedence detail).

Every supported launcher (Docker and Kubernetes) consumes the same contract:

| Env var | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `WORKFLOW_BUNDLE_PATH` | A mounted local bundle directory. |
| `WORKFLOW_BUNDLE_URI` | `file://`, `s3://`, `gs://`, or a presigned `https://` URL the runtime fetches and extracts. |
| `WORKFLOW_BUNDLE_CHECKSUM` | `sha256:<hex>` of the bundle's `manifest.yaml`; the runtime refuses to start if this doesn't match. |

Bundles are uniformly object-storage-backed: when
`RUNTIME_BUNDLE_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET` is set, session-manager uploads a freshly
built bundle and generates a short-lived presigned https URL for
`WORKFLOW_BUNDLE_URI`, so the runtime container needs no cloud SDK — just
plain https plus the standard library `tarfile`.

## Sync and versioning

Sync — whether the initial bootstrap sync, `make sync`, or the UI **Sync now**
button — runs one pipeline (`shared/lib/workflow_repo_sync.py::sync_workflow_repo`):

1. Fetch the source at the effective ref (pinned ref if set, else the
   bootstrap `WORKFLOW_REPO_REF`) — or read the current working tree in
   local-path mode.
2. Discover `workflows/*/agent.yaml`.
3. Rebuild every bundle and check `manifest.yaml`'s `platform_version` against
   the running platform's version (see [Compatibility policy](#compatibility-policy)).
4. Upload bundles to object storage, if configured.
5. Persist the result — synced ref/commit, discovered workflows, any bundle
   errors, sync status/error, timestamp — to the `control_plane.workflow_repo_state`
   singleton row.

For a remote source, Sync fetches the configured ref (such as `main`) or a
version pinned from the UI. A pin stays in effect for later syncs until changed.
Local-path mode never fetches and simply rebuilds from the mounted files. Sync
never touches bootstrap secrets (repo URL/PAT,
`AGE_IDENTITY`, `LLM_API_KEY`); changing those means re-running
`make bootstrap`.

### Compatibility policy

Compatible within a major version: if a bundle's `platform_version` major
component is newer than the running platform's, that bundle is blocked
("incompatible"); if older, it's built with a warning; if equal, it's OK.

### Gateway endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/platform/workflow-repo` | Current state: source, pinned/default ref, last sync result, discovered workflows, bundle errors. |
| `POST /api/platform/workflow-repo/sync` | Trigger the sync pipeline now ("Sync now"). |
| `POST /api/platform/workflow-repo/pin` | Set the operator-pinned ref (`{"ref": "..."}`), stored in Postgres and used by the next sync. |
| `GET /api/platform/workflow-repo/versions` | List released versions to pin from — GitHub-hosted repos only (queries the GitHub tags API with the bootstrap PAT); returns `[]` for other hosts. |

The control-plane UI's workflow-repo page only lets an operator change the
pinned version and trigger a sync; the repo URL and PAT are bootstrap-owned
and are never editable from the UI.
