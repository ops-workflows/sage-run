# Configuration

SAGE Run configuration is split into three layers so the workflow-repo
pointer is never circular (you shouldn't need the repo's own config file to
know how to fetch the repo).

| Layer | Owner | Committed? | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Bootstrap / infra | Operator | No (generated) | Workflow-repo pointer, `AGE_IDENTITY`, one `LLM_API_KEY`, and direct-container secrets (Postgres/object storage). A one-time PAT may be entered for the initial clone but is never written to an artifact. |
| 2. Instance config | Workflow repo | Yes (secrets age-encrypted) | `platform-config.yaml`: GitHub App connections, message bus, MCPs, connectors, memory banks, model profiles, workflow secrets. |
| 3. Workflow packages | Workflow repo | Yes | `workflows/`, shared `skills/`/`hooks/`, custom `mcps/`/`connectors/`. |

Boot sequence: read layer 1 → clone/sync the workflow repo at the pinned ref →
point `PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE` at the repo's `platform-config.yaml` → load layer
2 → build bundles → run. See [Deployment](deployment.md) for how layer 1 is
generated (`make bootstrap`) and how sync/versioning work.

## Layer 1 — bootstrap / infra settings

These are environment variables read by `shared/lib/config.py`'s `Settings`
class. Env vars always take precedence; unset ones may be overlaid from the
workflow repo's `platform-config.yaml` `config:` section once it has been
fetched (see [Loading order](#loading-order) below) — except
`WORKFLOW_REPO_URL`/`REF`, which are bootstrap-only and never read from
repo-owned config.

### Workflow repository

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WORKFLOW_REPO_URL` | `""` | Canonical Git URL of the workflow repo. A remote source syncs it; a local source uses it for GitHub version lookup and reflection PRs while continuing to use its mounted checkout. |
| `WORKFLOW_REPO_REF` | `""` | Git ref (tag/SHA) to sync; the bootstrap default until an operator pins a different ref from the UI. |
| `WORKFLOW_REPO_PATHS` | `""` | `os.pathsep`-separated list of mounted workflow roots (local-path source mode). Each entry can be a single workflow dir, a directory of workflows, or a repo root containing `workflows/`. |
| `WORKFLOW_REPO_LOCAL_PATH` | `/workspace/workflows` | Container-side path the workflow repo is synced/mounted to. |
| `REPO_PATH` | `""` | Path to a checked-out/mounted workflow repo root. |
| `HOST_REPO_ROOT` | `""` | Host-side bind-mount path used by the Compose convenience override. |

### GitHub App connections

Runtime GitHub access is app-only. Define named installations under
`github.connections` in `platform-config.yaml`. Each connection contains
`web_base_url`, `api_base_url`, `app_id`, `installation_id`, and a
`private_key_secret` reference into the age-encrypted `secrets` mapping. Set
`github.workflow_repo_connection` to the connection used for workflow sync,
version lookup, and reflection PRs.

GitHub.com and each GHES instance require separate GitHub Apps and keys. A
connection represents one App installation rather than only a domain, because
one host may contain multiple installations with different repository access.
Knowledge Sources select a connection by setting `credential_ref` to its exact
name, such as `github-public` or `github-enterprise`; a public source can leave it
empty. GitHub MCP repository aliases use the same connection names.

Grant each App only the repository permissions required by its installation:
`Contents: read and write` for sync plus reflection branches/commits,
`Issues: read and write` for GitHub MCP issue operations, `Pull requests: read
and write` for reflection PRs, and the automatically granted `Metadata: read`.
Do not grant `Workflows` unless the allowed reflection paths are intentionally
expanded to `.github/workflows`.

### Platform config file

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE` | `/app/platform-config.yaml` | Path to the instance's `platform-config.yaml`, read after the workflow repo is fetched. |

### Database

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PG_HOST` | `postgres` | Postgres host. |
| `PG_PORT` | `5432` | Postgres port. |
| `PG_DB` | `sage_run` | Database name. |
| `PG_USER` | `sage_run` | Database user. |
| `PG_PASSWORD` | `""` | Database password. |

### Object storage

One provider-neutral abstraction (`shared/lib/object_store.py`) backs both
workflow bundles and agent-memory backups across supported deployment targets.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OBJECT_STORE_PROVIDER` | `s3` | `s3` (MinIO, AWS S3, or any S3-compatible endpoint) or `gcs` (Google Cloud Storage). |
| `OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT` | `minio:9000` | Endpoint host:port (`s3` only). |
| `OBJECT_STORE_ACCESS_KEY` | `sage_run` | Access key (`s3` only). |
| `OBJECT_STORE_SECRET_KEY` | `""` | Secret key (`s3` only). |
| `OBJECT_STORE_SECURE` | `False` | Use TLS against the endpoint (`s3` only). |
| `OBJECT_STORE_GCP_PROJECT` | `""` | GCS project id; optional, the client can infer it from ADC. |

### Runtime bundles

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_ROOT` | `""` | Ephemeral local build/cache path for workflow bundles and synced config snapshots. |
| `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_URI_TEMPLATE` | `""` | Static bundle URI template, e.g. `gs://bucket/bundles/{workflow}.tar.gz`. |
| `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET` | `""` | Canonical bucket for immutable workflow release manifests, config snapshots, and bundles; runtimes receive presigned HTTPS bundle URLs. |
| `RUNTIME_BUNDLE_PRESIGNED_URL_EXPIRES_SEC` | `3600` | Presigned URL validity window. |

### Runtime launcher and memory sync

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUNTIME_LAUNCHER` | `docker` | `docker` or `kubernetes`. |
| `MEMORY_SYNC_MODE` | `docker_volume` | `docker_volume` for Compose or `filesystem` for a mounted memory path. Kubernetes Jobs use task-local `/memory` plus object-store restore/upload. |
| `MEMORY_FILESYSTEM_ROOT` | `/memory` | Container path agent memory volumes mount at. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_THINKING_MODE` | `default` | `default`/`on` leaves provider thinking behavior unchanged; `off`/`disabled` passes Claude Code's explicit thinking-disable switch. Provider support varies. |
| `KUBERNETES_MEMORY_HELPER_IMAGE` | `""` | Image containing `session_manager.memory_sync`; Helm defaults it to the session-manager image. |
| `KUBERNETES_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` | `""` | Bootstrap Secret name referenced by Kubernetes memory helper Jobs for object-store credentials. Helm sets it from `bootstrap.existingSecret`. |
| `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` | `default` | Kubernetes launcher namespace. |

### Gateway / UI

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GATEWAY_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Gateway bind address. |
| `GATEWAY_PORT` | `8080` | Gateway bind port. |
| `GATEWAY_EVENT_URL` | `http://gateway:8080/events` | Event-collector URL the runtime posts to. |
| `GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `""` | Publicly reachable gateway URL for Mattermost approval-action callbacks. |
| `CONTROL_PLANE_UI_URL` | `""` | Public control-plane UI URL. |

### Task admission

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLATFORM_MAX_RUNNING_TASKS` | `3` | Maximum concurrently admitted parent tasks across all workflows. Tasks are selected by `resume_pending`, workflow priority, then FIFO order. This does not cap parallel subagent or model calls inside a running task. |

Set each workflow's `runtime.priority` in `agent.yaml` to `high`, `medium`, or
`low` (or the equivalent `1`, `2`, or `3`). Equal-priority workflows retain FIFO
queue order. `runtime.parallel_workers` remains the per-workflow cap; platform
and workflow caps must both permit a task before it starts.

### Workflow concurrency and priority

Configure the platform-wide ceiling in the workflow repository's
`platform-config.yaml`:

```yaml
config:
  PLATFORM_MAX_RUNNING_TASKS: "3"
```

Configure each workflow in its `agent.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  parallel_workers: 1
  priority: high
```

`PLATFORM_MAX_RUNNING_TASKS` is the maximum number of concurrently running
parent tasks across the entire platform. `parallel_workers` is the maximum for
one workflow. A task starts only when both caps allow it.

`priority` controls selection among eligible queued tasks: `high` runs before
`medium`, which runs before `low`; use `1`, `2`, and `3` as equivalent numeric
forms. Tasks at the same priority retain FIFO order. A workflow at its
`parallel_workers` cap is skipped so the next eligible workflow can run.

These controls govern parent task admission only. A parent task may still launch
parallel subagents, so choose the platform cap below the available model-call
capacity when workflows use subagent fan-out.

### Message bus

Configure the provider only in `platform-config.yaml`:

```yaml
message_bus:
  provider: mattermost # mattermost or slack
  api_url: https://mattermost.example.com
  team_name: operations
  bot_token_secret: message_bus_bot_token
  app_token_secret: message_bus_app_token # Slack Socket Mode only
  action_callback_secret: message_action_callback_secret # Mattermost actions only

secrets:
  message_bus_bot_token:
    encrypted: "ENC[age,...]"
  message_bus_app_token:
    encrypted: "ENC[age,...]"
  message_action_callback_secret:
    encrypted: "ENC[age,...]"
```

Use exactly one of these provider mappings:

```yaml
# Mattermost
message_bus:
  provider: mattermost
  api_url: https://mattermost.example.com
  team_name: operations
  bot_token_secret: message_bus_bot_token
  action_callback_secret: message_action_callback_secret
```

```yaml
# Slack
message_bus:
  provider: slack
  api_url: https://slack.com/api
  bot_token_secret: message_bus_bot_token
  app_token_secret: message_bus_app_token
```

Mattermost needs a bot token, API URL, and an optional `team_name` when channel
names are ambiguous. New posts arrive through `/api/v4/websocket`; outbound
acknowledgements, results, questions, approval cards, and card updates use the
Mattermost REST API. Its interactive approval buttons call
`GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/webhooks/message/actions/approval`; configure an
`action_callback_secret` for that internal callback. Remove any old Mattermost
outgoing-webhook integration.

Slack needs a bot token with `chat:write`, `channels:read`, `groups:read`,
`channels:history`, and `groups:history` scopes (plus access to each configured
channel), and a Socket Mode app token. Enable message events and interactive
components in the Slack app. Message events and approval actions arrive through
Socket Mode; outbound messages and thread-history reads use the Slack Web API.
Slack does not use `action_callback_secret`.

Message-bus settings and secrets are never read from `MESSAGE_BUS_*`
environment variables. The Gateway opens one listener for the configured
`message_bus.provider`; no
separate message connector service is deployed. Mattermost uses
`/api/v4/websocket` for inbound posts and retains the Gateway HTTP
approval-action callback. Slack uses Socket Mode for both message events and
approval actions. The current deployment runs one gateway replica, because a
second replica would create a second live provider consumer.

Inbound provider messages are event-driven, not polled. The runtime does poll
Gateway APIs while waiting for an approval or human answer, but the Gateway
receives the provider event and persists it first.

`message_action_callback_secret` is an internal, independently generated
gateway secret. Mattermost receives it only inside the approval button context
and returns it to the approval callback. It is not a Mattermost token and is
not used for WebSocket authentication.

For `AskUserQuestion`, the runtime asks the gateway to post the prompt. When a
provider inbound message arrives in the same provider/thread, gateway ingress
persists a `user_question_reply` session event. The runtime polls the Gateway
reply API for that event; it never polls Mattermost or Slack threads directly.

Each workflow declares `messaging.channels` and `messaging.trigger_words` in
its `agent.yaml`. A channel may be its provider name (for example,
`operations`) or its provider ID. At gateway startup, configured names are
resolved once to IDs visible to the bot, so incoming provider events route
reliably even when they carry only a channel ID. Give the Slack bot access to
the channel and the `conversations.list` scopes required to enumerate it;
configure an explicit channel ID when the channel cannot be listed.
Matching is case-insensitive and an inbound message must start with a configured
trigger word. Omit neither `messaging.channels` nor `messaging.trigger_words`:
without a matching channel and prefix, no task is created.

For a triggering reply inside an existing Mattermost or Slack thread
(`message_id != thread_id`), routing and sender/alert trust checks run against
the triggering reply first. Only after it passes does the Gateway read thread
history through the provider API and build the task prompt from the latest 10
messages, oldest to newest, including the triggering reply. The trigger prefix
is removed from that final request. Root posts keep the existing single-message
behavior. If history retrieval fails or the bot lacks history permission, task
creation stops rather than running without the required conversation context.

Mattermost hydration uses `GET /api/v4/posts/{root_id}/thread` with the
triggering post's `fromPost` and `fromCreateAt` cursor values; the bot must be
able to read the channel and thread. Slack hydration uses
`conversations.replies`; the bot must be a channel member and have the history
scope appropriate to that channel type (`channels:history` or
`groups:history`). Both providers apply the same latest-10 prompt limit and
record the included count as task metadata under `thread_context_count`.

### Hindsight memory

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HINDSIGHT_URL` | `http://hindsight:8888` | Hindsight service base URL. |
| `HINDSIGHT_REQUEST_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry count for Hindsight API calls. |
| `HINDSIGHT_REQUEST_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC` | `0.5` | Initial retry backoff. |

### Housekeeping / retention

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOUSEKEEPING_ENABLED` | `True` | Enable the periodic background job. |
| `HOUSEKEEPING_INTERVAL_SEC` | `3600` | How often it runs. |
| `BACKGROUND_JOB_RUN_HISTORY_LIMIT` | `5` | How many of its own past runs to keep. |
| `TASK_ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS` | `14` | Archive completed tasks after N days. |
| `TASK_DELETE_AFTER_DAYS` | `0` | Delete archived tasks after N days (`0` = never). |
| `LEARNING_MEMORY_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Hindsight learning-bank retention. |
| `AGENT_MEMORY_VERSIONS_TO_KEEP` | `10` | Versioned agent-memory snapshots to retain per workflow. |
| `AGENT_MEMORY_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Delete agent-memory snapshots older than N days. |

### Secrets (age encryption)

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGE_PUBLIC_KEY` | `""` | Recipient public key (`age1...`) used to encrypt new secrets. Safe to commit. |
| `AGE_IDENTITY` | `""` | Private key used to decrypt secrets at container-spawn time. Bootstrap-only, never committed. Accepts an armored key string or `file:/path/to/key.txt`. |

### LLM API key

`LLM_API_KEY` is operator-owned and lives only in the bootstrap
layer — it is the single model-access key passed to a model gateway or direct
LiteLLM-compatible endpoint, Hindsight's LLM and embeddings clients, and
referenced from `model_profiles` entries in `platform-config.yaml` as
`${LLM_API_KEY}`. There is no per-provider key variable; a workflow
selects a model via `session.model` in `agent.yaml`, which resolves to a
`model_profiles` entry (or a raw model name). Hindsight can use that same
endpoint for both clients, but its embedding model must still be an actual
embedding model exposed by that endpoint; it is configured independently from
the chat model.

### Compose environment files

For Compose deployments, two files are loaded automatically by the
public Makefile:

1. `workflow-repo/deploy/compose.env` is committed and contains **only
  non-secret production values used before services can read
  `platform-config.yaml` (for example public URLs, host bindings, sandbox
  mode, database names, and Hindsight base URLs/models).
2. `sage-run/compose.env` is generated by `make bootstrap`,
  gitignored, and contains direct-container secrets and paths. Production mode
  includes the OIDC client and proxy-cookie secrets. Local mode instead writes
  inert auth values and overrides the production public URLs, sandbox mode, and
  auth-ingress replica count.

The generated file is loaded last. Bootstrap does not rewrite workflow routes,
connector targets, subscriptions, or schedules for local use. Workflows and
connectors start paused; operators must review those settings before resuming.
Application settings and ordinary workflow credentials remain in the workflow
repo's `platform-config.yaml`/`agent.yaml`; services that can decrypt them do
so after startup. Postgres, MinIO, and Hindsight cannot, so their direct
secrets belong in the bootstrap layer.

### Loading order

At import time, `shared/lib/config.py` calls `load_platform_env` (see
`shared/lib/platform_secrets.py`) against `PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE`, decrypts its
`secrets:` block if `AGE_IDENTITY` is set, and overlays each resulting value
onto `Settings` **only if the corresponding env var isn't already set** — so
an explicit bootstrap env var always wins over the repo's config file.

## Layer 2 — `platform-config.yaml` reference

This file lives in the workflow repo (see
[examples/workflow-repo/platform-config.example.yaml](../examples/workflow-repo/platform-config.example.yaml)
for the public template) and is read only after the platform has
cloned/synced the repo.

```yaml
config:            # plain deployment env vars (DB/object-store overrides, custom
                    # workflow env, INSTANCE_NAME, AGE_PUBLIC_KEY, ...)

mcps:
  enabled: [...]    # which MCP servers this instance runs
  config:           # per-server policy, keyed by server id (see docs/mcps.md)

connectors:
  enabled: [...]    # which connector instances this deployment runs
  instances:        # instance configs, keyed by instance id (see docs/connectors.md)

message_bus:
  provider: mattermost | slack

runtime_bundles:
  storage: s3
  bucket: sage-run-bundles
  retention_versions: 20

runtime_env:        # env injected into every runtime container; a value of
                    # `null` removes a built-in var instead of setting it
  DISABLE_TELEMETRY: true

default_model_profile: local

model_profiles:      # named env-var bundles selected via agent.yaml session.model
  local:
    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: http://local-llm:8000
    ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN: ${LLM_API_KEY}
    ANTHROPIC_MODEL: some-model-name
    CLAUDE_CODE_THINKING_MODE: default
    CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS: "8192"
    CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS: "65536"
    CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW: "65536"
    CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE: "90"

memory:
  backend: hindsight
  banks:             # workflow name -> Hindsight bank id, per kind
    business:
      my-workflow: incident-rca-my-workflow
    learning:
      my-workflow: workflow-learning-my-workflow

message_bus:
  provider: mattermost
  api_url: https://mattermost.example.com
  bot_token_secret: message_bus_bot_token

secrets:              # age-encrypted platform-wide secrets
  message_bus_bot_token:
    encrypted: "ENC[age,...]"
```

`${VAR}` placeholders anywhere in this file are expanded from `config:`
values, decrypted `secrets:` values, and the process environment at load time
(`shared/lib/platform_secrets.py::expand_env_placeholders`).

Reasoning-history handling and sampling controls such as temperature, top-p,
top-k, and presence penalty belong in the model gateway or inference deployment
when the Anthropic-compatible client does not expose them as workflow settings.

### Encrypted secrets

Secrets are age-encrypted (X25519, via the `pyrage` library) and stored as
`ENC[age,<base64-ciphertext>]`. `AGE_PUBLIC_KEY` (safe to commit) encrypts new
values; `AGE_IDENTITY` (bootstrap-only, never committed) decrypts them at
container-spawn time. Use `make set-platform-secret` for shared values in the
configured `platform-config.yaml`, or `make set-workflow-secret
WORKFLOW=<workflow-name>` for values in a workflow's `agent.yaml`. Both commands
prompt securely for the secret name and value, then run `make sync` to rebuild
the active workflow release through the running gateway.

Per-workflow secrets follow the same `encrypted: ENC[...]` shape under a
workflow's own `agent.yaml` `secrets:` block — see
[Workflow authoring](workflow-authoring.md).

## Layer 3 — workflow packages

`workflows/`, shared `skills/`/`hooks/`, and any custom `mcps/`/`connectors/`
the workflow repo ships. See [Workflow authoring](workflow-authoring.md) for
the package layout and bundle assembly rules.
