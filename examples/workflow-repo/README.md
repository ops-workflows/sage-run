# Example Workflow Repo

This directory mirrors the exact structure a **workflow repo** must have to
work with SAGE Run. Copy it (or just the pieces you need) to
bootstrap your own workflow repo:

```sh
cp -r examples/workflow-repo /path/to/my-workflow-repo
```

See [docs/workflow-authoring.md](../../docs/workflow-authoring.md) for the
full package/bundle reference, [docs/configuration.md](../../docs/configuration.md)
for the config-layer model, and the platform root
[README.md](../../README.md) for how to point a running platform at your repo.

`workflows/example-workflow/` is a **copy-and-fill template** — its
`agent.yaml`, `.mcp.json`, `settings.json`, and `agents/*.md` still contain
`{PLACEHOLDER}` values (`{WORKFLOW_NAME}`, `{MAIN_AGENT}`, `{ROLE}`, ...). It
is not meant to run as-is; see its own
[README.md](workflows/example-workflow/README.md) for the fill-in steps. Its
`settings.json` demonstrates a `permissions.ask` entry (approval-gated tool
calls) and a populated `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` matching the MCP
servers wired in its `.mcp.json` — customize both for the servers your own
workflow actually uses. Adding integrations (Salesforce, Splunk, connectors,
...) shipped by the platform is documented in
[docs/mcps.md](../../docs/mcps.md) and [docs/connectors.md](../../docs/connectors.md);
adding your own custom MCP server or connector is documented in
[mcps/README.md](mcps/README.md) and [connectors/README.md](connectors/README.md)
in this example.

This example intentionally ships no root `CLAUDE.md`. If you add one to your
own workflow repo, it **replaces** (not merges with) the platform's shared
`CLAUDE.md` in the bundle — see
[Bundle assembly](../../docs/workflow-authoring.md#bundle-assembly).

## `agent.yaml` validation

The platform validates every discovered `agent.yaml` against
[schemas/agent-yaml-schema.json](../../schemas/agent-yaml-schema.json)
automatically — the gateway's provisioner runs this on every startup and every
workflow-repo sync, for every instance. A malformed `agent.yaml` is logged as
a validation warning; nothing in your workflow repo needs to ship or wire up
the schema itself.
